# What's this?
It's a C++20 warez scene name parser library. It's meant to parse file names of scene releases, like this one:

`Random.Movie.Name.2015.German.DL.1080p.BluRay.x265-ReleaseGroup`

There's no exact specification for this naming, it's more of a convention for release groups to follow. Wikipedia
has a small article about this "standard": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_(warez)

# How?



# Why?

I am interested in all things warez/scene. I also plan to use it in the future for writing a small utility 
for release tagging.

# Is this illegal?

This is a pretty academic project, just a parser. If you use it to parse your collection of Linux ISOs, that's your 
own decision.
